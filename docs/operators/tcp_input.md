## `tcp_input` operator

The `tcp_input` operator listens for logs on one or more TCP connections. The operator assumes that logs are newline separated.

| ---               | ---              | ---                                                                               |
| `id`              | `tcp_input`      | A unique identifier for the operator                                              |
| `output`          | Next in pipeline | The connected operator(s) that will receive all outbound entries                  |
| `max_buffer_size` | `1024kib`        | Maximum size of buffer that may be allocated while reading TCP input              |
| `listen_address`  | required         | A listen address of the form `<ip>:<port>`                                        |
| `tls`             | nil              | An optional `TLS` configuration (see the TLS configuration section)               |
| `write_to`        | $                | The body [field](/docs/types/field.md) written to when creating a new log entry |
| `attributes`      | {}               | A map of `key: value` pairs to add to the entry's attributes                         |
| `resource`        | {}               | A map of `key: value` pairs to add to the entry's resource                       |

#### TLS Configuration

The `tcp_input` operator supports TLS, disabled by default.

| Field             | Default          | Description                               |
| ---               | ---              | ---                                       |
| `cert_file`       |                  | Path to the TLS cert to use for TLS required connections.   |
| `key_file`        |                  | Path to the TLS key to use for TLS required connections.       |
| `ca_file`         |                  | Path to the CA cert. For a client this verifies the server certificate. For a server this verifies client certificates. If empty uses system root CA.        |
| `client_ca_file`  |                  | Path to the TLS cert to use by the server to verify a client certificate. (optional)   |


### Example Configurations

#### Simple

Configuration:
```yaml
- type: tcp_input
  listen_address: "0.0.0.0:54525"
```

Send a log:
```bash
$ nc localhost 54525 <<EOF
heredoc> message1
heredoc> message2
heredoc> EOF
```

Generated entries:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2020-04-30T12:10:17.656726-04:00",
  "body": "message1"
},
{
  "timestamp": "2020-04-30T12:10:17.657143-04:00",
  "body": "message2"
}
```
